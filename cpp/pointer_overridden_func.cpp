/*In this program, we have created a pointer of Base type named ptr. This pointer points to the Derived object derived1.
When we call the print() function using ptr, it calls the overridden function from Base.
This is because even though ptr points to a Derived object, it is actually of Base type. So, it calls the member function of Base.*/
